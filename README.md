# VAMPIRE CLOCK

## What it does:

This clock is intended for youthful ~~humans~~ vampires who have not yet learned to tell the difference between night and day. 

When the clock is on it's "Slumber" setting, it's not safe to go outside because the sun will _destroy_ you. However, when the clock is on it's "Feed" setting, you're morally obligated to hunt humans, thus continuing the survival of our wonderful species.

## About

My goal was to take a common clock project and put my own self amusing spin on it. This clock uses HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and the _Date()_ API.
